        <h2>While you're here, why don't you listen for a bit?</h2>
        <span>I was born at a very young age, and became a teenager at roughly the age of thirteen.</span>
        <span>Around that time, I made a wonderful discovery: the beauty that was, is, and always will be <span class="rainbow">GNU</span>/<span class="rainbow">LINUX</span>.</span>
        <span>For the uninitiated, <span class="rainbow">GNU</span>/<span class="rainbow">LINUX</span> is the second best operating system (second only to NeXT's OPENSTEP).</span>
        <span>Written in the mythical language known as 'C,' <span class="rainbow">GNU</span>/<span class="rainbow">LINUX</span> is sleek, efficient, and beautiful.</span>
        <span>I am getting ahead of myself, however. I am talking about my life story, not my choice of OS.</span><br />
        <h4>EXPOSITION</h4>
        <span>It was not because of Linux that I got interested in programming.</span>
        <span>I was already interested.</span>
        <span>Rather, Linux is what propelled my interest in programming to where it is today.</span>
        <span>In the eighth grade I decided to enroll myself in the "Intro to Computer Programming" course.</span>
        <span>Before this point, I had never seriously considered programming as anything more than Scratch and something my friends liked to do.</span>
        <span>Because of this, I merely enrolled on a whim, hoping that there would be some cute programmer chicks in my class.</span>
        <span>Spoiler: there were not.</span>
        <span>However, I learned a lot of Java, but could only write console applications and a very basic approximation of 'Snake.'</span>
        <span>I loved the course so much that I enrolled in "Advanced Computer Programming" for the second semester of eighth grade.</span>
        <span>This time around I was taught much more Graphical programming and learned enough to code my own custom Minecraft launcher!</span>
        <span>In all honesty, those were truly the days.</span><br />
        <h4>RISING ACTION</h4>
        <span>Ahh, ninth grade.</span>
        <span>That time of life where you suddenly transition from an awkward teenager to an awkward, hormonal teenager.</span>
        <span>Truly my prime.</span>
        <span>In any case, I was prepared to double down on my academic studies this year.</span><br />
        <span>Goofing off? No! Procrastination? No! School? HELL YES!</span><br />
        <span>I had enrolled in all the honors courses offered at my level, and even managed to get into AP Computer Programming Principles!</span>
        <span>Sadly, as I found out too late, this was way too many classes.</span>
        <span>APCSP was going pretty poorly at the beginning of the year, grade wise, but I was certainly enjoying it.</span>
        <span>First semester was when I learned my <span class="rainbow">trash</span> HTML & CSS skills.</span>
        <span>In all seriousness, I did actually learn quite a bit of technique about proper HTML & CSS formatting to get such websites as this.</span>
        <span>First semester came and went, and with it I had gone through the eSports team, one play, and only failed one Math test! Things were looking good!</span>
        <span>With the second semester, I realized just how many courses I had signed up for.</span>
        <span>I had one free period, three honors courses, and one AP course!</span>
        <span>Even still, I somehow managed to do somewhat well the third quarter.</span>
        <span>We learned Python in APCSP, and I wrote a library that would eventually inspire my Create Task.</span>
        <span>However, I did an oopsie in the fourth quarter and managed to fail a Math test.</span>
        <span>Given that I failed one last semester I figured that I could just try a bit harder and get a good grade.</span>
        <h4>CLIMAX</h4>
        <span>And then I failed another test.</span><br />
        <span>And another.</span><br />
        <span>At this point, my Math grade had gone from a 93.3% to a 69.1% over the course of three weeks.</span>
        <span>If I even managed to get a passing grade, I knew for sure that I'd never make it into Honors Algebra Two, and to get a passing grade I'd need to get a perfect 100% on every coming test.</span>
        <span>With just one free period and three other Honors+ classes, it felt impossible and I felt... defeated.</span>
        <h4>DEFEAT</h4>
        <span>It was clear to me that I'd be lucky to pass Math with a B-, and that anything above a B was likely impossible.</span>
        <span>I also knew that if I focused as much as it required to pass Math, I would surely fail my other classes.</span>
        <span>To top it all off, I had a Create & Explore Task due by the end of the Quarter for APCSP and I would fail if I didn't turn those in.</span>
        <span>Luckily, I was given the perfect opportunity out.</span>
        <span>With Covid-19 on the rise, school was forced to shut down and we did all our classes at home.</span>
        <span>Because of this, I now had vast swaths of time that I could dedicate towards any work that I needed to do.</span>
        <span>My teachers didn't make it easy, and I pulled a lot of all nighters before tests, but I made it through.</span>
        <span>At the Mid-Quarter, I saw my grades had skyrocketed because of all my efforts.</span>
        <span>My one last challenge was the Math final.</span>
        <span>I knew in my other classes that I could prepare for the final with minimal effort, since most teachers made them easy.</span>
        <span>I also knew my Math teacher didn't like to make them easy.</span>
        <h4>FALLING ACTION</h4>
        <span>Again, whatever fate there is out there came to my rescue.</span>
        <span>Because many students' grades were dropping due to Covid-19, they were making Final exams optional!</span>
        <span>In another stroke of luck, the Math department made a special curve for the Final that would drastically benefit the students' grade no matter what.</span>
        <span>In other words, if I took the Final and did well my grade was almost guaranteed to go up one level!</span>
        <span>Since my grade in Math was now a B+, that would've meant I would go up to an A-!</span>
        <span>In short, I studied as hard as I could for the Final and passed with flying colors!</span>
        <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
        <span>By the end of ninth grade I had miraculously passed all of my classes with straight A's!</span>
        <span>Obviously I haven't gone into much detail on my social life, I'll go into that once I set up my posting system.</span>
        <span>I hope this did give you some insight into my life's story, however!</span>
