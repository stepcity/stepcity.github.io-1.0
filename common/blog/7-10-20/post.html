    <span>I got a cool new desktop, yall!</span><br />
    <span>Firstly, I should probably show you a cool screenshot to give an idea of what it looks like.</span>

    <span>I assume since you've even read this far into my blag you'll think this is a fucken' sexy desktop.</span>
    <span>Anyways, that's it.</span>
    <span>Just wanted to show off my new desktop.</span>
    <span>Short post today.</span><br /><br />
    <span>Oh, by the way, if you want to know what OS/Shell this is it's OpenSUSE Tumbleweed running the Trinity Desktop Environment.</span>
    <span>It's really quite fun to use and it didn't take me long at all to set it up to look this good.</span>
