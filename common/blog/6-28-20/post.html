    <span>Today was an <span class="rainbow">interesting</span> day, to say the least.</span><br /><br />
    <h4 class="glow">EXPOSITION</h4>
    <span>Yesterday, I was woken up at 7:30 to go on an "early morning walk."</span>
    <span>No matter, it was a nice walk, except for the bit where I had to wake up.</span>
    <span>I also got some cool new clothes, which comes into play today.</span>
    <span>Anyways, today they decided to go on another early walk, and I was pretty pleased to see we were taking the van.</span>
    <span>See, taking the van to a walk usually means that we're going somewhere further away, and there's only so many walks we know of.</span>
    <span>This time, however, I was told that we'd be trying a new, half mile nature loop.</span>
    <span>Since it was supposed to be pretty, shady, and short, I had donned my fresh attire in preparation.</span><br /><br />
    <h4 class="glow">ARRIVAL</h4>
    <span>We arrived at the trail, one "Dixie Canyon Trail."</span>
    <span>We should've turned back as soon as we heard the screams.</span><br />
    <span>No, seriously. There was this family with these loud-ass kids.</span>
    <span>We didn't even get outside the van before we heard them shouting from the trail, it was that loud.</span>
    <span>In any case, my parents didn't care so we started off (with masks, of course).</span>
    <span>The second red flag was at the trail's head; there was a great big sign that said, "BEWARE OF POISON OAK."</span>
    <span>Considering that I could barely see what was under the foliage, it did concern me quite a bit.</span>
    <span>Regardless, we pressed on!</span><br /><br />
    <h4 class="glow">THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM</h4>
    <span>Thankfully I didn't encounter any poisin oak in the first "half" the trail.</span>
    <span>It started off innocently enough, we started walking, it was a bit overgrown, etc.</span>
    <span>Normal trail stuff.</span>
    <span>About six minutes in we got to a bridge that crossed a stream.</span>
    <span>We were also now in direct sight of the children mentioned earlier.</span>
    <span>Immediately, as though he were a dog running in a game of fetch, he ran towards my dad.</span>
    <span>Thankfully, his parental unit intercepted him (small children can only run so fast), preventing a potential crisis.</span>
    <span>However, this family seemed a bit confused as to where the trail went from here.</span><br />
    <span>You see, there were at this point four ways to go.</span>
    <span>In front of me there was a path that seemed overgrown with poison oak and behind me was where I came in.</span>
    <span>To my left, there was a path that headed back, seemingly towards the van, and to my right there was a path that seemed to go uphill.</span><br />
    <span>In our infinite wisdom, we consulted the map.</span>
    <span>According to the map (which could have been more clear) we were supposed to go somewhere to the right, suggesting the uphill path.</span>
    <span>And so it was! We set out, going up the hill, and...</span><br /><br />
    <h4 class="glow">OH SHIT OH FUCK</h4>
    <span>Well, it didn't go well.</span>
    <span>The hill started sloping upwards at what seemed like 60 - 65 degrees, which is a lot.</span>
    <span>The path was so narrow and overgrown that we had to duck under bushes and trees, and since it was on loose dirt we also had to dodge mini-landslides.</span>
    <span>Since it was so narrow and overgrown we couldn't actually turn around, so we were stuck going up.</span>
    <span>Oh, and there was also the occasional poison oak that would try to snatch me while I climbed.</span>
    <span>Thankfully my training as a Boy Scout and my fear of touching anything that could have spiders led me to avoid any interactions with poison oak.</span>
    <span>Several times, the dog decided that he had had enough and tried to turn around... at which point he tumbled into me and had to keep walking. Sorry, Cassady.</span>
    <span>After what felt like hours we finally reached level ground.</span>
    <h4 class="glow">OUT OF THE FRYING PAN</h4>
    <span>And in to the fire. We had a couple options on where to go but the general consensus was that we had made a mistake and needed to get out of there.</span>
    <span>But of course that didn't happen.</span>
    <span>No, instead we continued walking onwards, and eventually reached what was finally open ground.</span>
    <span>Something like a dry meadow, and we had several ways to go now.</span>
    <span>My parents advocated for adventure, which I think was stupid, while Ben pointed out the obvious continuation of trail.</span>
    <span>My Mom suggested trying to get to Mulholland, a road nearby, and from there trying to get back to the van.</span>
    <span>Since our map was telling us we were close to the road, we walked away from the trail and found ourselves behind someone's backyard.</span>
    <span>It was clear that we weren't going that way, so we went back on Ben's route.</span><br /><br />
    <h4 class="glow">SURVIVOYEUR</h4>
    <span>After about a half hour of walking on the trail Ben spotted, we saw three kids about my age walking towards us.</span>
    <span>They said that they had come up that way... meaning freedom was near!</span>
    <span>In our excitement to leave we wandered through the labyrinthine trail, getting stuck in dead ends, going in circles, you know the drill. Lost.</span>
    <span>Anyways, we found ourselves behind the backyard of another, much bigger house.</span>
    <span>This time we were near the road our van was parked on, which was even better.</span>
    <span>I suggested trying to ask for help from inside the house since we were clearly lost, but that thought was nixxed when it's owner came outside.</span><br />
    <span>"GO BACK! GET THE FUCK BACK WHERE YOU CAME! THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY!" said the owner.</span><br />
    <span>Clearly this option was not gonna happen, so we turned around and complied.</span>
    <span>This time we said, "Fuck it, let's just try to go back down that hill."</span>
    <span>After what felt like hours of wandering around, we found our way to an intersection.</span>
    <span>With some investigation we found we were on the side of the hill, and we could see Mulholland from where we were.</span><br /><br />
    <h4 class="glow">FREEDOM</h4>
    <span>But oh, not yet.</span>
    <span>Straight ahead we saw what looked like some kind of supply road, which suggested freedom, but after peering around the corner I decided it wasn't worth it.</span>
    <span>Ben, ever the voice of logic, suggested that we go that way.</span>
    <span>After rolling for charisma he won over my parents and we ended up going that way.</span>
    <span>We finally emerged from the hill in the driveway of the first house, who thankfully did not pay any mind to us.</span>
    <span>After a walk to the road, we felt something we hadn't felt all day: a nice, cool breeze and a drizzle of rain, possible to signify our release from the first layer of hell.</span>
    <span>Nonetheless, we were able to make it to freedom from there.</span>
    <span>After reading the reviews of the walk a bit more thoroughly, I decided that the moral of this story is to always read the reviews.</span>
