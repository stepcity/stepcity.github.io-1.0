    <span>Felt like I haven't been posting on here enough so Ima do a post</span><br /><br />
    <span>So obviously not much has changed on here, I've just been messing with the code and making it cleaner.</span>
    <span>I do have an important question for all of you 5 people who look at this,<span>
    <span>What should I base my custom Operating System off of?</span>
    <span>I was thinking either XV6 or MINIX, both are very small and easy for me to understand (code wise).</span>
    <span>If I choose XV6 it'll be closer to a blank slate, since MINIX is closer to a complete OS.</span>
    <span>It might also be fun to take XV6 and MACH and use them together, since I can use XV6 as a "springboard" to developing MACH.</span>
    <span>I dunno, just email me whichever one you think is best.</span><br /><br />
    <span>P.S. I'm gonna post anime stuff on my Instagram ack ack ack cuz I think that's what the world needs so here's a freebie</span><hr />
