The rules for contributing are very simple: Don't.
At least not without asking me several times and telling me exactly what you're doing.
This is a personal page and an exercise in programming. If other people contribute without my confirmation, it won't be purely my exercise anymore.
If you want to fork it and do something fun, feel free. If you want to use it's code for something else, feel free.
But it is my project and I'd prefer it to stay that way.
